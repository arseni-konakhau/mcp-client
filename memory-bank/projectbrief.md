# Project Brief: MCP Client

## Overview
This is a Java Spring Boot application that implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client. The project uses Spring AI's MCP client starter to enable communication with MCP servers.

## Core Requirements
- **Primary Goal**: Create a functional MCP client that can connect to and interact with MCP servers
- **Technology Stack**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.3, Spring AI 1.0.0
- **Architecture**: Standard Spring Boot web application with MCP client capabilities

## Project Scope
- Implement MCP client functionality using Spring AI's MCP client starter
- Provide web-based interface for MCP interactions
- Enable communication with external MCP servers
- Support standard MCP operations (tools, resources, prompts)

## Key Constraints
- Must use Java 21 as the target language version
- Built on Spring Boot 3.5.3 framework
- Uses Spring AI 1.0.0 for MCP client implementation
- Gradle-based build system

## Success Criteria
- Application starts successfully
- Can establish connections to MCP servers
- Provides functional web interface for MCP operations
- Handles MCP protocol communications correctly
- Maintains clean, maintainable code structure
