# Product Context: MCP Client

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard for enabling AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. However, implementing MCP client functionality from scratch is complex and time-consuming. Developers need a ready-to-use, well-structured MCP client that can serve as both a functional application and a reference implementation.

### Target Users
- **Developers** building AI applications that need to connect to MCP servers
- **System Integrators** looking to connect AI systems with existing tools and data sources
- **AI Researchers** experimenting with MCP protocol implementations
- **Enterprise Teams** needing secure, reliable MCP client functionality

## How It Should Work

### Core Functionality
1. **Server Connection Management**
   - Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
   - Handle authentication and security protocols
   - Manage connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

2. **MCP Operations**
   - **Tools**: Discover and execute tools provided by MCP servers
   - **Resources**: Access and retrieve resources from connected servers
   - **Prompts**: Utilize server-provided prompts and templates

3. **Web Interface**
   - User-friendly dashboard for managing MCP connections
   - Interactive tool execution interface
   - Resource browsing and management
   - Real-time status monitoring

### User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Easy setup and configuration
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and connection management
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into MCP operations and status
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with custom functionality
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections

## Value Proposition
- **Accelerated Development**: Reduces time to implement MCP client functionality
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrates proper MCP protocol implementation
- **Production Ready**: Built with enterprise-grade Spring Boot framework
- **Maintainable**: Clean architecture that's easy to understand and extend

## Success Metrics
- Successful connection to various MCP server implementations
- Reliable execution of MCP tools and resource access
- Positive developer experience when using or extending the client
- Clean, well-documented codebase that serves as a reference
